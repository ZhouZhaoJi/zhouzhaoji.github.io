      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Karen Elizabeth Gordon, author of ‘The Transitive Vampire’, dubbed the verb the ‘heart-throd’ of the sentence. Verbs should do most of the work in a sentence. They describe the state of being of the subject of a sentence, express an action, or describe an occurrence of the subject of a sentence.<br>Verbs are divided into two classes: finite and non-finite. <a id="more"></a><br>The base form of a verb is what you see in a dictionary. It will have the marker ‘to’ in front of it.<br>Finite verbs can be joined by linking verbs and helping verbs.<br>They are classified as either transitive or intransitive, according to whether or not they act upon an object in the sentence.<br>Verbs form the tense of a sentence, which indicates the time of the action. They can also express mood: that is, whether a sentence is a statement, an order, or expresses a potentiality or something hypothetical.<br>Finally, verbs can indicate whether the subject of a sentence is acting or being acted upon. This is called the voice of the verb.<br>Linking, or copular, verb link a subject with a complement that describes or explains it, restates the subject, or describes its state of being. Thay include sensory verb, like hear, look, taste, smell, feel, and verbs such as be. appear, seem, become, grow, remain, stay, prove, sound, and turn(when referring to a state or condition).<br>Helping, or auxiliary, verbs assist in forming tenses when combined with a main verb. Parts of the verb ‘to be’, the verb ‘to do’, and the verb ‘to have’ are the primary auxiliary verbs.<br>Modal auxiliary verbs, or simple modal verbs, indicate modality. When combined with a base verb form they suggest a condition, need, likelihood or probability, requiement or obligation, ability, or premission.<br>Transitive verbs are verbs that express an action carried out on one or more objects.<br>While they require a direct object to complete their meaning, they can also relate to an indirect object.<br>Intransitive verbs don’t require an object to complete their meaning. They are complete in themselves.<br>Let’s move now on to other kinds of verbs.<br>Verb phrases are compound verbs. That is, they comprise a main verb and a helping verb.<br>Not to be confused with verb phrases, which we have just looked at, phrasal verbs, or prepositional verbs, as they are sometime known, are very different. A phrasal verb is a two- or three-word verb consisting of a main verb plus a preposition or adverb vital to the meaning of that verb. Note that you must take care never to hyphenate a phrasal verb.<br>Non-finite verbs, also referred to as verbals, consist of the infinive, participle, and gerund verbs forms. Unlike finite verbs, they can’t complete an independent clause nor dose their form change.<br>Participles can be either present or past tense, and require the addition of a helping verb to make a verb phrase. The present participle always ends in ‘-ing’. The past participle ends in ‘-d’ or ‘-ed’ most of time, but can have an irregular ending. The past participle can function as an adjective.<br>The gerund is a non-finite verb that always end in ‘-ing’, and always functions as a noun.<br>Both present participles and gerund end in ‘-ing’. Whether a verb is a past participle or a gerund depend on its function in a sentence. Some grammarians call both gerund and participles ‘gerund-participles’.<br>Our last non-finite verb form is the infinitive. The infinitive form of a verb is its ‘base’ form, and is most often introdeced by the marker ‘to’. Some people believe that it’s wrong to split an infinitive. This rule came about because the infinitive in Latin is a single word, and so cannot be split. In English, the infinitive is two words, and so can be freely split.<br>One final addition to this lecture is the verbal phrase. Recall that non-finite verbs are sometimes called verbals. A verbal phrase consists of a non-finite verb and the words that modify it.<br>Remember, verbs form the core of the sentence usully doing most of its work.</p>]]></content>
