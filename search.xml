      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A sentence is the expression of a complete thought. It is made up of a clause. A clause is a group of words that contains a subject and a predicate. Clauses can be put into two kinds: independent/main clauses and  dependent/subordinate clauses.<br>An independent/main clause consists of a subject and a predicate and can stand alone as a sentence.<br>A dependent/subordinate clause starts with a subordinate word.  It can not stand alone as a sentence though it consists of both a subject and a predicate.<br>Depending upon the number and type of clauses it contains, a sentence may be one of four kinds.<br><a id="more"></a></p><h1 id="Simple-sentences"><a href="#Simple-sentences" class="headerlink" title="Simple sentences"></a>Simple sentences</h1><p>The most basic type of sentence is a simple sentence. Usually, A simple sentence contains one independent/main clause. To be complete, it must have at least one subject and one predicate. Both the subject and the predicate may have modifiers. Simple sentences can be very effective for drawing a readerâ€™s attention, but you have to use them with care: too many simple sentences can make your writing seem choppy and childish.</p><h1 id="Compound-sentences"><a href="#Compound-sentences" class="headerlink" title="Compound sentences"></a>Compound sentences</h1><p>A sentence that has at least two or more main/independent clauses is called a compound sentence. All of the main clauses of a compound sentence have their own subject(s) and their own predicate(s) and these main clauses are of equal importance in grammar. Usually, a compound sentence is joined by</p><ol><li>a coordinating conjunction</li><li>a conjunctive adverb</li><li>a semicolon alone</li></ol><p>A compound sentence is most effective when you use it to create a sense of balance or contrast between two or more equally-important pieces of information.</p><h1 id="Complex-sentences"><a href="#Complex-sentences" class="headerlink" title="Complex sentences"></a>Complex sentences</h1><p>A sentence that has one main/independent clause(MC) and one or more subordinate/dependent clauses(SC) is called a complex sentence.<br>A subordinate clause is headed by a subordinate conjunction and a relative pronoun, functioning in the sentence as a noun, an adjective or an adverb.<br>There are four punctuation patterns:</p><ol><li>SC + , + MC</li><li>MC + SC</li><li>Main + , + nonessential SC + , + clause</li><li>Main + essential SC + clause</li></ol><p>Clauses of complex sentences are of unequal importance in grammar, one being dominated by the other. A subordinate clause presents the information naturally supplementing the information of the main clause.</p><h1 id="Compound-complex-sentences"><a href="#Compound-complex-sentences" class="headerlink" title="Compound-complex sentences"></a>Compound-complex sentences</h1><p>A sentence that has two or more main/independent clause(MC) and at least one subordinate/dependent clause(SC) is called a compound-complex sentence.
